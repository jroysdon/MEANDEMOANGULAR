# MEAN DEMO - ANGULAR

I wrote this through a class in MEAN Development. 
This is the front end (Angular) code
I am often asked for examples of my work. The issue is that much of what I've done is behind corporate firewalls and is proprietary. 

This code is to show I can work in the MEAN full stack: 

Mongo (and other NoSQL databases), though I also have worked in Relational DBs)
Express (to se up micro services)
Angular (the Front End)
NodeJS (the back end)
