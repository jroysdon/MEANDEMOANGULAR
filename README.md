# MEAN DEMO - ANGULAR

I wrote this through a class in MEAN Development. 
This is the front end (Angular) code
I am often asked for examples of my work. The issue is that much of what I've done is behind corporate firewalls and is proprietary. 

This code is to show I can work in the **MEAN** full stack: 

* Mongo (and other NoSQL databases), though I also have worked in Relational DBs)/n
* Express (to se up micro services)
* Angular (the Front End)
* NodeJS (the back end)

I added to the course work the ability to register and verify the EMAIL address by using *NodeMail* to send an confirmation email. 
I added the ability to reset the user's password from the profile, request a new password (again, sending a link), and the ability to delete completely the user's profile and the option to delete all the user's content. 

Finally, this application is served up through *AWS S3* on the front end, *AWS Elastic Beanstalk* on the back end, and MongoDB through *Cloud Atlas*.
